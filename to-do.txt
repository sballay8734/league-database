1. Re-write all functions to do ONE thing
    a. One set should take in an owner and a year to calculate yearly stats

    b. Other set should use the above functions to find the totals by looping   through the years and running the function once "forEach" year.
        i. But use a regular "for" loop if possible for performance

        For Example: To find totalPointsRegSzn, you could run...

          let totalPointsRegSzn = 0
          const years = Object.Keys(owner.regSzn)
          years.forEach((year) => {
            totalPoints += totalPoints(owner, year)
          })
        
          // Find owner in static data
          // Overwrite totalPointsRegSzn in staticData

        For Example: To find totalPointsPlayoffsOnly, you could run...

          let totalPlayoffPoints = 0
          const years = Object.Keys(owner.playoffs)
          years.forEach((year) => {
            totalPoints += totalPoints(owner, year)
          })

          // Find owner in static data
          // Overwrite totalPlayoffPoints in staticData

3. Re-write app to read data from static data rather than performing ALL calculations on ever render.

4. Migrate data to MongoDB

5. LOGO and THEME CHANGE are in the way on small screens. Re-work

6. Move Carousel to its own component

7. Need to smooth Carousel transition when using dropdown and clicking pagination

8. Theme Persistence

9. Default Owner Selection

10. Maybe put stat choice and "all-time || by season" choice next to name dropdown in OwnerView
